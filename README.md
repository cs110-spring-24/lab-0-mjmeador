## Instructions

In the `hello.py` file, create a variable called `name` that stores your name as a string. Then, print out "Hello" followed by your name. For example, if your name is "John", the program should print out "Hello John".

## Running the program

To run the program, type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python3 hello.py
```

*Note: If you're using Windows, you may need to use `python` instead of `python3`.*
